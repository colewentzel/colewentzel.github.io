# Hi, I'm Cole.
I'm an electrical engineering grad student at Tufts University (and a Boston University computer engineering alumni). I really enjoy working with hardware and low-level code.

I wanted to make this site to document my own thought process as I learn new things and undertake projects. Hopefully I'll give myself a laugh and a way to reflect as I work through new challenges.

<div style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 1rem">
<img src="/assets/img/public/programming_as_kid.jpg" data-src="/assets/img/public/programming_as_kid.jpg" alt="programming_as_kid.jpg" class="img" style="width: 40%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 0; border-radius: 5%;">
<span style="margin-top: 0;"><i>Me, circa 2005.<br>I've been using computers longer than I've been able to write.</i></span>
</div>

When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, I spend my time rolling stats in order and playing outrageous characters in DnD, jamming to rock music on my guitar, drawing portraits of my friends, and not being good enough for my college’s figure skating team. I also “enjoy” weightlifting.
