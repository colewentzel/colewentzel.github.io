    "content": "In the pursuit of better organizing my thoughts, I decided to carve out my own corner of the internet with this very website.I wanted to have a place where I could write fun documentation with a smidge of humor, while also cataloging the steps I’m taking while I figure out each project. Plus, I can use my silly documentation to write actually good documentation later, so this is a double win.This is a recounting of my journey setting everything up (updated as I attempt to add new fun customizations) along with some potential tips to help anyone else who decides to follow in my footsteps.IntroductionI initially thought setting up a web page would be a trivial task, as there are tons of tools already out there for making websites. Heck, several services exist where you can make a one-page portfolio for free, and there are several more full website-builder type services where you pay monthly for them to host your site for you.The issue I saw with these solutions is:  Lack of flexibility. A lot of these sites have set templates and all sites have to follow them in some way. I wanted to be able to edit any element to look any way I want.   look at this!  Lack of portibility. These providers own the assets used to make websites on their platforms, and typically make migration difficult. This means I can't take my design with me if I decide to change providers or export the code. I'd have to rebuild if I were to move.  I want to learn! Using a website builder doesn't actually help me learn front-end development.That's so expensive for a site that will get so little traffic...and I can't take the design with me if I decide to switch hosts &gt;:(Although I have some experience using Bootstrap to setup a page using HTML, CSS, and a smidge of JavaScript, I am not very experienced and decided to build my page using Jekyll and host on Github Pages. This automates some of the difficulties of setting up a way to neatly display my posts and other musings but also allows me to directly edit the CSS of the page as I get more confident.I’m able to add a new page by typing it out in a markdown editor and run a build command to update the website! But… I can modify the CSS of the site, change how posts are rendered, and have those changes propagate through all of my past posts when I rebuild.SetupBefore setting up Jekyll, I wanted to configure my domain name to work with Github Pages. I’ve owned colewentzel.com for over two years, but I never did anything with it.When I bought it, I wanted to make a custom email address"
