# Hi, I'm Cole.
I'm a computer engineering student at Boston University. I really enjoy working with hardware and low-level code.

When I'm not sitting in front of a computer, I spend my time include rolling stats in order and playing outrageous characters in DnD, jamming to rock music on my guitar, drawing portraits of my friends, and not being good enough for my college’s figure skating team. I also “enjoy” weightlifting.
